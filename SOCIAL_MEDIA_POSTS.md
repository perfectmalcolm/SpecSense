**Option 2 (More Technical):**

> I'm excited to share my submission for the Google #CloudRunHackathon: SpecSense.

> SpecSense is an intelligent web application designed to solve gadget "analysis paralysis." Instead of comparing complex spec sheets, users can describe what they're looking for in plain English (e.g., "a lightweight laptop for travel with great battery life"), and our Gemini-powered backend provides a personalized recommendation.
>
> For this project, we implemented a full-stack solution:
> - A serverless backend API using Python, FastAPI, and Docker, deployed on Google Cloud Run.
> - A responsive frontend using React, hosted on Firebase Hosting.
> - AI-powered recommendations generated by the Google Gemini API.
>
> This architecture is scalable, cost-effective, and demonstrates the power of combining Google's serverless and AI platforms. It was a great experience pushing the boundaries of what these tools can do.
